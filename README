A template for creating ebooks (epub and pdf) from markdown files on Windows.

Short how-to:

* Install make, pandoc and some version of latex (originally used with MiKTeX).
* Place docx-files with simple formatting in the docx-folder and type `make` on the command line in the folder. (Formatting assumes: level 1 headings as chapter headings, no fancy formatting otherwise.)
* Move the markdown-files created in the root folder. Fill out the metadata required and place the images in img-folder. Optionally, place cover.jpg in the root folder. Type `make` on the command line again.

Templates need the following YAML:

Markdown files for the pdf-files that are typeset as separate files should have:

	---
	title: the long title, used on the front page
	short-title: the short title, used in the header
	author: author name, used on the front page and at the beginning of the text
	lang: a latex formatted language code, e.g. 'finnish'
	separate: 'true', is used to change the layout for the files typeset separately
	cover: is optional, but should point to a file in the root, e.g. 'cover.jpg'
	---

metadata.yaml needs to have:

	---
	collection: 'true' to indicate that the metadata is for the collect pdfs
	lang: a latex formatted language code, e.g. 'finnish'
	title: the long title, used on the front page
	short-title: the short title, used in the header
	---

metadata.yaml can optionally have:

	---
	toc: 'true' if you want to include a table of contents
	cover: is optional, but should point to a file in the root, e.g. 'cover.jpg'
	cover-image: is a duplicate of cover: it is used by the built-in ebook-template
	creator:
	- role: creator is optional, but should have the author, editor etc. info options are MARC-relators recognized by pandoc, e.g. 'author', 'editor'
	  text: name of the author
	- role: editor
	  text: name of the editor
	- role: pfr
	  text: name of the proofreader
	publisher: name of the publisher
	date: year of publication
	rights: copyright information
	---
